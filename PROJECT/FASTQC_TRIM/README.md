*Authors: Pauline Romeyer & Kewin Ogink*
*Date: 25-1-2019*
*Purpose: Check .fastq.gz trimmed data using the program FastQC.*

## Functioning
This script will run all Single End (SE) and Paired End (PE) data from the Nasonia/PROJECT/TRIM/RESULTS directory through the program FastQC, which will check the quality of the reads.
The output will be located in FASTQC_TRIM/RESULTS.
Relevant output data is .html and .zip files of images of the quality of the reads. These allow for manual quality check.
Subsequently the next step, BWA, will be executed
